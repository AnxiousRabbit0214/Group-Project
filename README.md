CMPT 300 contains two programs ferry.c and smaug.c 

ferry.c is a program that simulates the loading/unloading process of ferry by generating and synchronizing mutiple user-level threads using mutexes and global variables. Deadlock prevention is implemented by defining a linear order on resources.

smaug.c is a program that simulates the interaction between a dragon named smaug, hunters and thieves by generating processes that represent thieves and hunters at random interval, managing and synchronizing them with the parent process (smaug) using named semaphores and sem_wait/sem_trywait.
